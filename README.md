Project Explanation:

The project is a Django-powered website for a fictitious Dior store. Here's a summary of the
current status of the project:

The home page is the website's landing page that displays prominent items and promotions.

Women's part: This part is dedicated to women's items, such as beauty, purses, and shoes.
The products and prices listed here are retrieved from the database.

Men's area: This area features items such as cologne and shoes. Products and prices are
retrieved from the database, as with the women's area.

Cologne & Beauty area: A specialized area providing information on cologne and beauty
goods sourced from the database.

Contact Page: A contact form that allows users to submit questions, which are stored in the
database and followed by a confirmation email. This page also contains a FAQ section.

Search functionality: When users click the search button, a search bar displays, allowing
them to search for goods. The search results contain product names and photos, which are
dynamically retrieved based on the user's input.

Django Debug Toolbar: The project provides a django-debug-toolbar, which helps with
debugging during development. It includes precise performance measurements and SQL
query analysis, making it easy to optimize and debug the application.

and manage photos and other media formats. Media files are kept in a specific directory and
provided by the Django development server.
